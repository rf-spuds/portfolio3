# portfolio3

For this portfolio I wanted to use Bulma CSS. 

I decided to use a template instead of building it from scratch. I appreciate how robust this framework is. One con is that it requires media queries for true responsiveness. This is not the case for my personal favorite [MaterializeCss](https://materializecss.com/).
